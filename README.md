# AI-Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a puzzle game that consists of a grid of cells, where some of the cells contain hidden “mines”. 
By clicking on a cell that contains a mine, it is detonated causing the user to lose the game. Clicking on a “safe” cell 
(i.e., a cell that does not contain a mine) reveals a number that indicates how many neighboring cells – where a neighbor 
is a cell that is one square to the left, right, up, down, or diagonal from the given cell – contain a mine.
